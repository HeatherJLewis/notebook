## C is for Cascading

Three things decide which styles get applied:

1. Importance: normal (any style) or !important ( color:red !important;)
2. Specificity: see below
3. Source order: see below

Specificity 4. !important 5. ids 6. Classes, pseudo classes, attribute selectors 7. Type selectors (elements and ::pseudo-elements)

Look at the element that is being styled. Add the total number of each category in the selector expression. Treat this like a software version number.
0.4.2 = .red .big p.one.two span {}
1.1.1 = #simon p.first {}
The second version is more important and gets applied seconf (if these were pointing at the same element)

Source Order
CSS declarations come from different origins:

- the user agent (browser) style sheet;
- the author style sheet;
- and the user style sheet;

Within the author style sheet origin we also have:

- external stylesheet
- embedded <style> element;
- inline style attribute

Specificity is used to break ties.
