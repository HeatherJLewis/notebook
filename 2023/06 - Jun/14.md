## CSS Float and Clear Properties

- not really used now
- tries to tell browser how to cope with image that's in a paragraph that's taller than the line height
- image - display - inline-block
- float: left - moves the image so it is to the left of the paragraph
- clear: applied to affected element - clear: left drop the paragraph below anything floated to the left

## CSS text-shadow

- to put shadow on letters themselves
- text-shadow: 2px 2px 40px red
- text-shadow: right down blur radius colour
- can add multiple shadows - commas between
