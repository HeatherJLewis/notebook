# Learning CSS

Notes made from: [Steve Girffith's Learning CSS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyuRouwmQCjl4wTSNbb8RTKZuyMhoIxBe).

## Pseudo Classes vs Pseudo Elements

- classes apply to elements that exist inside html
  - an element under certain conditions
- elements don't exist as a tag
  - we're creating something that can be styled
  - two colons
  - defines content and injects into html
  - more than just before/after
    e.g. first-letter, first-line, selection

## :nth-child Selectors

- :nth-child(an + b)
- :first-child
- :last-child
- :nth-last-child(b)
- p:first-of-type
- :last-of-type
- :nth-of-type(an + b)
- :nth-last-of-type(b)
- can use odd/even

```
ul li:nth-child{
    color: red;
}
```
