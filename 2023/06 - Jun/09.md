# Learning CSS

Notes made from: [Steve Girffith's Learning CSS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyuRouwmQCjl4wTSNbb8RTKZuyMhoIxBe).

## CSS Height Vs Line Height

- font size doesn't mean line height
- fonts have different sizes
- line height - how much space allotted to each line of text
- extra space over the font size goes above the text
- height - height for the entire element
- line height - height of the line of text - vertical space provided for text
- if line height < font size ascenders/descenders stick out

## CSS Display vs Visibility

- visibility hidden - leaves a space where the element should be - the element is still in the DOM
- display none - removed from the DOM - everything moves to fill its space
