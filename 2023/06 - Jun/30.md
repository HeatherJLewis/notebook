## CSS Position

- watch this one again!
- static - default
- absolute - moves relative to the closest ancestor with a position of relative - content is wrapped to content, removed from page flow - takes its original position and then margin is applied,
- relative - moves relative to it's position in the document flow and the original space is still there
- fixed - stays as page is scrolled - same as absolute - removed from document flow - maintains position relative to the viewing area
- sticky - like fixed but contained in a certain area
