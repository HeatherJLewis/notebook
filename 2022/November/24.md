Notes made from: [React Chapter 4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/react-and-react/9781803231280/B18316_04_ePub.xhtml).

## Sharing data using context Hooks

Notes made from: [React Context & Hooks Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RhOzQciVwI)
Still struggling to get this.

## Creating Context with functional components

## Reading List Project 1

- Create a context folder
- Follow from tutorial 16

## Reducers

- pattern of coding centralises methods for changing state into a single function
- used in Redux
- could become unweildy if we had lots of functions
- easier to maintain if we have just one function
- reducer is just a pattern - don't have to do this
- Reducer Function interacts with the state/data
- Action {type: 'ADD_BOOK'}
- dispatch to reducer

dispatch({type:'ADD_BOOK', book: {}}) -> reducer(action, state) -> Provider value

- check the action.type
- update the state object
- return the state

## [useReducer()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXWycyeTeCs)

- from react

```
const [age, dispatch] = useReducer(ageReducer, 20)

```

- age reducer is just a switch
- action is an object with a type property
