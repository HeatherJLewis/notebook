# Component State?

Notes made from: [Component State](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html).

## What does setState do?
setState() schedules an update to a componentâ€™s state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

## What is the difference between state and props?
* props and state are plain JS objects
* props get passed to the component (like fn params)
* state managed within component (like declaring vars in a fn)

## Why is setState giving me the wrong value?
```
incrementCount() {
  // Note: this will *not* work as intended.
  this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1});
}

handleSomething() {
  // Let's say `this.state.count` starts at 0.
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();
  // When React re-renders the component, `this.state.count` will be 1, but you expected 3.

  // This is because `incrementCount()` function above reads from `this.state.count`,
  // but React doesn't update `this.state.count` until the component is re-rendered.
  // So `incrementCount()` ends up reading `this.state.count` as 0 every time, and sets it to 1.

  // The fix is described below!
}
```
* pass in a fn
* setState call are batched which lets you chain updates
* they then build on top of each other rather than conflicting

```incrementCount() {
  this.setState((state) => {
    // Important: read `state` instead of `this.state` when updating.
    return {count: state.count + 1}
  });
}

handleSomething() {
  // Let's say `this.state.count` starts at 0.
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();

  // If you read `this.state.count` now, it would still be 0.
  // But when React re-renders the component, it will be 3.
}
```
