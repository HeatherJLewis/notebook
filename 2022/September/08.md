# Thinking in React

[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html).

* single responsibility principle
* separate UI into components where each component matches one piece of the data model
* state - interactivity - data that changes over time
* React has a one way data flow - one way binding
* state change -> triggers changes in data model
* keep state to a minimum
* it's not state if:
1. it's passed via props
2. it's unchanged over time
3. it's computable from other state or props
