# Props vs State

[Props Vs State](https://github.com/uberVU/react-guide/blob/master/props-vs-state.md).

## Context
* Main responsibility for a component is to turn raw data into rich HTML

## Common Ground
Both props and state:
* are plain JS objects
* trigger a render on update
* deterministic -> with the same input, the same component should be rendered

## Props
* component's configuration - options
* immutable as far as the component is concerned - can't change it's props

## State
* can be changed over time
* component manages its own state internally
* can't change the state of its children

#### Changing _props_ and _state_

| | _props_ | _state_ |
--- | --- | ---
Can get initial value from parent Component? | Yes | Yes
Can be changed by parent Component? | Yes | No
Can set default values inside Component?* | Yes | Yes
Can change inside Component? | No | Yes
Can set initial value for child Components? | Yes | Yes
Can change in child Components? | Yes | No

\* Note that both _props_ and _state_ initial values received from parents override default values defined inside a Component.

* state is optional
* state increases complexity and unpredictability
* components can be stateless (dumb) or stateful - state managers
