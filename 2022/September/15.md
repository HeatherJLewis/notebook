# ReactJS: Props vs. State

Notes made from: [ReactJS: Props vs. State
](https://lucybain.com/blog/2016/react-state-vs-pros/).

## Props
* properties
* passed into a component
* similar to how an argument is passed into a function
* can have default props
* can't change props
* any component which only uses props can be described as pure - always renders the same output given the same input

## State
* by default a component has no state
* used to keep track of info between renderings
* the component can create, update and use state
* state is changeable - when setState updates the state object it automatically re renders the component
* always use setState to update state
* for classes always pass in a function to setState - due to asynchronous nature

> props contains information set by the parent component (although defaults can be set) and should not be changed.

> state contains “private” information for the component to initialise, change, and use on it’s own.
