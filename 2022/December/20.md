Notes made from: [CSS for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT).

## Pseudo Selectors

- special keywords that go after selectors
- they can be used to target:
  - special behavioural states
  - advanced structural elements

* Pseudo class groups:
* dynamic - behaviour - on hover
* structural - parnet child relationships
* dynamic pseudo classes allow us to style an element in relation to user actions such as:
  - whether a link is beign hovered over
  - whether a button is being pressed
  - whether a tick box has been checked
* Structural pseudo classes allow us to style elements based on advanced structural techniques not possible from ordinary CSS selectors

  - the 5th <li> tag in a list
  - a parent tag that has no children

* e.g. all link tags coloured on hover
* selector:keyword{ declaration }

```
a:hover{
    color: red;
}
```

## Hover, Active and Visited States

```
a:hover{
    color: red;
}

a:active{
    color: orange;
}

a:visited{
    color: purple;
}
```

## First and Last Child Selectors

```
// html
<article>
    <p class="deck halls">Published by me</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
</article>

// CSS
article p:first-child{
    color: green;
    font-weight: bold;
}
article p:last-child{
    color: red;
}
```

## First and Last of Type Selectors

- can't do the same as above as we've got different tags in the acticle section
- can use first of type and last of type e.g. first/last p tag

```
// html
<article>
    <h2>Article</h2>
    <p class="deck halls">Published by me</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
    <hr>
</article>

// CSS
article p:first-of-type{
    color: green;
}
article p:last-of-type{
    color: red;
}
```

## nth Child Selector

```
// html
<article>
    <p class="deck halls">Published by me</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
</article>

// CSS
article p:nth-child(3), article p:nth-child(4){
    color: green;
}
```

- can also pass other stuff into the nth-child class

```
article p:nth-child(even){
    color: green;
}

article p:nth-child(odd){
    color: pink;
}

article p:nth-child(2n + 1){
    color: blue;
}
```

## nth of type Selector

- in an html file with lots of tags on the same level, you can target the nth of a specific type:

```
// html
<article>
    <h2>Article</h2>
    <p class="deck halls">Published by me</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
</article>
<hr>
<article>
    <h2>Article</h2>
    <p class="deck halls">Published by me</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
</article>
<hr>

// CSS
article:nth-of-type(1){
    color: green;
}
```

## Combining Selectors

```
// grab the article element which has a featured-content class
article.featured-content {
  background: pink;
}

// grab the element which has a featured-content class and is nested inside the article element
article. featured-content {
  background: pink;
}
```

## Universal Selector

- styles everything - mostly!
- can be used in a CSS reset

```
// everything blue
*{
    color: blue
}

// everything blue but overridden by browser styles e.g. Link tag
body{
    color: blue
}
```
