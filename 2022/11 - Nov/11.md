# Chapter 4 - Getting Started with Hooks

Notes made from: [React Chapter 4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/react-and-react/9781803231280/B18316_04_ePub.xhtml).

## Maintaining state using Hooks

- useState()

```
import * as React from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [name] = React.useState("Adam");
  const [age] = React.useState(35);

  return (
    <>
      <p>My name is {name}</p>
      <p>My age is {age}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

- one call to useState() for each piece of state
- updating state:

```
const [name, setName] = React.useState("Adam");
```

- Each piece of state uses its own Hook and has its own value variable and its own setter function.

## Performing Initialisation and Cleanup Actions

- Often, our React components need to perform actions when the component is created. For example, a common initialization action is to fetch API data that the component needs.
- Another common action is to make sure that any pending API requests are canceled when the component is removed.

### Fetching component data

The useEffect() Hook is used to run "side-effects" in your component. Another way to think about side-effect code is that functional components have only one job â€“ returning JSX content to render. If the component needs to do something else, such as fetching API data, this should be done in a useEffect() Hook. For example, if you were to just make the API call as part of your component function, you would likely introduce race conditions and other difficult-to-fix buggy behavior.
