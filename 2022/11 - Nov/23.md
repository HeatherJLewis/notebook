## Sharing data using context Hooks

Notes made from: [React Context & Hooks Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RhOzQciVwI)
Still struggling to get this.

## Multiple Contexts

- create several contexts - one for each type of data or part of the app e.g. authentication, theme

## Hooks (Tutorial 9)

- special functions
- allows us to do stuff in fn components e.g. useState()

- useState() - use state within a functional component
- useEffect() - run code when a component renders (or re-renders)
- useContext() - consume context in a functional component

## useState() Hook

- have to update the entire object when you use setState()

## useEffect() Hook

- like a lifecycle method in a class component
- takes a callback function - runs everytime the component renders or re renders - data change
- could communicate with database
- can use it as often as you like in a component

## useContext()

- can use useContext() as often as you like

## creating Context with functional components
