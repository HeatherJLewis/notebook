# Getting Started with CSS

Notes made from: [Getting Started with CSS](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-started-css/).

## Creating HTML

- used span not h3 because it's a full sentence

## Variables and Styling Setup

`:root` includes the entire DOM pseudo class

- pseudo class takes higher specificity
- by default the browser puts padding /margin to it so remove it by setting these to zero on the body
- universal selector has no sepcificity to it
- the double colon is a pseudo element as opposed to a pseudo class
- line height - adding a unit - sets an absolute height - without the unit it's a proportion
