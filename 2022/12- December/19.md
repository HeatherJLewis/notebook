Notes made from: [CSS for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT).

## Inheritance

- nested element styling over rides parent element styles

```
<body>
    <div>
        <p>Text</p>
    </div>
    <h1></h1>
</body>
```

- except 'a' tag - has it's own styling - default browser styling

## 12 - Specificity in CSS Conflicts

p{color: black}
p{color: red} - this wins as it's lower in the cascade

#main-content p{color: black} - targets all the p tags inside the element with the main-content id - this wins as it's more specific (101)
p{color:red} (1)

- IDs 100 points
- Classes 10 p oints
- Elements 1 point

```
#main-content p{color: black} - implicitly targets strong
p{color: red} (1)
.test{color: green}
strong{ explicitly targets strong
    color: cyan;
}
```

strong wins because #main-content p targets the p tags

- whichever selector has the most points wins

## Important

- can't be overridden
- don't use it unless you absolutely have to

```
p{
    color: red !;
}

#main-content p {
    color: green;
}
```

## Targeting Multiple Different Elements

```
p, span, a, li{
    color: green;
}
```

## Descendent Selectors

- nested elements
- parent then child - no comma

```
#main-content #sub-content p{
    color: magenta;
}
```

## Child Selectors

- children take into account how deeply nested they are - 1 level deep

```
#main-content > p{
    color: red;
}
```

- '>' child combinator
- this means take all p tags that are direct children on #main-content

## Adjacent Selectors

- take parent (all-articles) and h2 then all p tags adjacent to this

```
#all-articles h2 + p{
    color: green;
}
```

## Attribute Selectors

- all span elements with a class attribute

```
span[class]{
    color: purple
}

div[id]{
    color: cyan;
}

a[title="search engine"]{
    color: red;
}
```

- can also do pattern matching
- tilda for contains
- caret for the beginning, dollar sign for the end

```
span=[class~="deck"]{
    color: purple;
}

a[href$=".pdf"]{
    color: green;
}

a[href^="http"]{
    color: pink;
}
```
