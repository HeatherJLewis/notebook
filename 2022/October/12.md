# Chapter 2 - Rendering with JSX

Notes made from: [React Chapter 1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/react-and-react/9781803231280/B18316_02_ePub.xhtml).

## Sub heading

```
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const root =
  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render( // method takes JSX as an argument renders it to DOM node passed to ReactDOM.createRoot()
  <p>
    Hello, <strong>JSX</strong>
  </p>
);
```

- JSX transpiled to JS statements
- declarative - described what to render not how
- I find it helpful to think of declarative as structured and imperative as ordered. It's much easier to get things right with a proper structure than to perform steps in a specific order.
- The render() function tells React to take your JSX markup and transform it into JavaScript statements that update the UI in the most efficient way possible.

## HTML tag conventions

- lowercase for tag name
- tag names are case sensitive and non-HTML elements are capitalised

- React Component - custom TAG
