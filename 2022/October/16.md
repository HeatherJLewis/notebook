# Chapter 3 - Component Properties, State and Context

Notes made from: [React Chapter 3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/react-and-react/9781803231280/B18316_03_ePub.xhtml).

## Passing Property Values

- properties are only set once when the component is rendered

## Default property values

```
import * as React from "react";

class MyButton extends React.Component {
  static defaultProps = {
    disabled: false,
    text: "My Button",
  };

  render() {
    const { disabled, text } = this.props;

    return <button disabled={disabled}>{text}</button>;
  }
}

export default MyButton;
```

- properties are immutable
- state changes all the time

## Setting property values

- React component properties are set by passing JSX attributes to the component when it is rendered.

## Pure functional components

- Picture the render() method of any React component that you've seen. This method, in essence, is the component. The job of a functional React component is to return JSX, just like a class-based React component. The difference is that this is all a functional component can do. It has no state and no lifecycle methods.
- Functional components rely on property values being passed to them for anything dynamic.

## Default props

- Functional components are lightweight; they don't have any state or lifecycle.

```
import * as React from "react";

const MyButton = ({ disabled, text }) => (
  <button disabled={disabled}>{text}</button>
);

MyButton.defaultProps = {
  text: "My Button",
  disabled: false,
};

export default MyButton;
```

## Container components

- The basic premise of container components is simple: don't couple data fetching with the component that renders the data. The container is responsible for fetching the data and passing it to its child component. It contains the component responsible for rendering the data.
- Containers are an important concept in React applications, as they help to separate the work of getting data and using data to render markup.

## Context

[Context](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/react-and-react/9781803231280/B18316_03_ePub.xhtml#_idParaDest-65)

- There are two key concepts to remember when using contexts in Reactâ€” providers and consumers. A context provider creates data and makes sure that it's available to any React components. A context consumer is a component that uses this data within the context.

App.js

```
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { PermissionProvider } from "./PermissionContext";
import App from "./App";

const root =
  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(
  <PermissionProvider>
    <App />
  </PermissionProvider>
);
```

PermissionContext.js

```
import * as React from "react";

const { Provider, Consumer } =
  React.createContext("permissions");

class PermissionProvider extends React.Component {
  state = {
    first: true,
    second: false,
    third: true,
  };

  render() {
    return <Provider
      value={this.state}>{this.props.children}</Provider>;
  }
}

const PermissionConsumer = ({ name, children }) => (
  <Consumer>{(value) => value[name] && children}</Consumer>
);

export { PermissionProvider, PermissionConsumer };
```

- context should be used sparingly because it can be confusing to understand where data comes from.
