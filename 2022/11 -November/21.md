## Sharing data using context Hooks

Notes made from: [React Context](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-context-for-beginners/)
Needed a bit more guidance for this.

- use it when a piece of data could be used by any component
- should be data that doesn not need to be frequently updated
- helps to avoid props drilling
- from React 16

1. Create context using the createContext method.
2. Take your created context and wrap the context provider around your component tree.
3. Put any value you like on your context provider using the value prop.
4. Read that value within any component by using the context consumer.
   React.createContext()
