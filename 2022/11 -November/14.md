# Chapter 4 - Getting Started with Hooks

Notes made from: [React Chapter 4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/react-and-react/9781803231280/B18316_04_ePub.xhtml).

## Cancelling requests

- needed if the componount is unmounted and an API call needs to be cancelled
- otherwise an error occurs
- return a function from the useEffect() hook which runs when the component is removed

```
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const promise = fetchUser().then((user) => {
      setId(user.id);
      setName(user.name);
    });

    return () => {
      promise.cancel();
    };
  });
```

## Optimizing Side-effect actions

- By default, React assumes that every effect that is run needs to be cleaned up.
- This typically isn't the case. For example, you might have specific property or state values that require cleanup when they change.
- You can pass an array of values to watch as the second argument to useEffect() â€“ for example, if you have a resolved state that requires cleanup when it changes, you would write your effect code like this:

```
const [resolved, setResolved] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => {
  // ...the effect code...
  return () => {
    // ...the cleanup code that depends on "resolved"
  }
}, [resolved]);
```

- In this code, the cleanup function will only ever run if the `resolved` state value changes. If the effect runs and the `resolved` state hasn't changed, then the cleanup code will not run.

## Blocks of code

```
let message = 'Hello world';
alert(message);
```
