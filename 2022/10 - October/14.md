# Chapter 3 - Component Properties, State and Context

Notes made from: [React Chapter 3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/react-and-react/9781803231280/B18316_03_ePub.xhtml).

## What is component state?

- state is the dynamic part of the react component
- t changes over time
- it can be initialised
- whenever you tell a React component to change its state, the component will automatically re-render itself
  initial state -> state -> render
  setState()

## What are component properties?

- Properties are used to pass data into your React components. Instead of calling a method with a new state as the argument, properties are passed only when the component is rendered, that is, you pass property values to JSX elements.
- don't change after the initial render
- rendering and re-rednering a component using properties:
  render() -> JSX -> Props -> Component -> render -> ...
