# Chapter 2 - Rendering with JSX (Second Half)

Notes made from: [React Chapter 2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/react-and-react/9781803231280/B18316_02_ePub.xhtml).

## Children

```
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import MySection from "./MySection";
import MyButton from "./MyButton";

const root =
  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(
  <MySection>
    <MyButton>My Button Text</MyButton>
  </MySection>
);
```

```
import * as React from "react";

class MySection extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <section>
        <h2>My Section</h2>
        {this.props.children}
      </section>
    );
  }
}

export default MySection;
```

```
import * as React from "react";

class MyButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <button>{this.props.children}</button>;
  }
}

export default MyButton;
```

## JS Expressions

- Any time React renders JSX content, expressions in the markup are evaluated.
- map returns an array - think about it!

```
    <ul>
      {array.map((i) => (
        <li key={i}>{i}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>

    <ul>
      {Object.keys(object).map((i) => (
        <li key={i}>
          <strong>{i}: </strong>
          {object[i]}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
```

- fragments <></>
- indicates that only the children need to be rendered
- doesn't add unnecessary elements in the DOM
- less HTML rendered on the page
