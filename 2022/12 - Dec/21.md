Notes made from: [CSS for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT).

## Font Size

- Absolute or Relative

* Absolute
  - Pixels (px)
* Relative
  - ems
  - percentages

```
// html
<h1>Heading</h1>
<article>
    <h2>Article</h2>
    <p class="deck halls">Published by me</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
</article>
<hr>
<article>
    <h2>Article</h2>
    <p class="deck halls">Published by me</p>
    <p class="deck">stuff</p>
</article>
<hr>

// CSS
// Pixels
h1{
    font-size: 48px;
}

// ems
article{
    font-size: 16px;
}
h2{
    font-size: 3em; (3*16px)
}
article p{
    font-size: 50%
}
```

- 3em - take base font size you're inheriting and times by 3 (48px)
- 50% - font size is 50% of inherited style

## Font Family

- search computer for arial and use it otherwise default back to browser
- if we don't want this, we can create a font family stack (fallbacks)

```
article{
    font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif ;
}
```

## Text Decoration

- ONE of: none, underline, overline, inherit, line-through,

```
p{
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

## Font Weight

- ONE of: bold, bolder, lighter, inherit, normal, 100 - 900
- lighter might not work with the default font family
- not all fonts are available in bold, light
- "Yu Gothic" is a font which does

```
p{
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

## Text Transform

- Change the letter casing
- ONE of: capitalize, inherit, lowercase, none, uppercase
- capitalise makes every word have a capital

```
#header p{
    text-transform: ;
}
```

## Text Color

- color controls text colour
- can use names, hex codes

```
h1{
    color: red;
    background-color: grey;
}
```

## Styling Links

- just be aware of people's expectations of what a link looks like

```
a{
    color: red;
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

## 34 Letter Spacing and Line Height

- letter spacing - l e t t e r

  - inherit, normal, px, em, %
  - 2em don't inherit from parent
    - inherit font size
    - so this would be 2 \* 24px

- word spacing - space between words
  - ems work the same as for letter spacing
- line height
  - vertical space between lines
  - the font size is 12px,
  - vertical height of the whole line so the extra is 18px (12px + 18px = 30px)
    - ems work the same as for letter spacing - needs to be at least 1em so it can't be less than 1

```

p{
    font-size: 12px;
    letter-spacing: 10px;
    word spacing: 12px;
    line-height: 30px;
}

```
